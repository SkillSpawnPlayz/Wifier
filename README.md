this batch file can be a rubber ducky or a manual. once ran it will download and update python modules but in the back ground it will snatch wifi data from wifi's you've connected to ages or rn. you need to make a folder named: private &amp; txt file named: DeTA.txt for it to work or just edit the path at the end of the cmd prompt lol.
